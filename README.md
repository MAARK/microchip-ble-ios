# Microchip RN4020 BLE Data Exchange with Swift 2.0 

This repo contains Swift 2.0 demo code that was used as part of a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_AgTZCYLqU) demonstration to connect an iOS app to a Microchip RN4020 BLE test device. Since the Xcode project and Pod libraries are now outdated, only the relevant BLE source code is included. Therefore, while this is not a complete example, the hope is that this source code can be a reference and starting point for Swift 3.0 usage.  

### Disclaimer 

This code is compatible with Swift 2.0 and will need to be migrated for use with latest versions of Xcode.
